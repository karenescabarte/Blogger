				Computer programming, also known as coding, has been a highly sought
				after profession since the inception of the computer itself. I don’t
				know how many times I’ve heard the phrase, “Computers don’t do anything
				that you don’t tell them to,” and even in today’s technical day and age,
				many still don’t understand how true this statement is. Computers are
				only novel electronic boxes without programmers providing them with
				instructions in the form of software. Having the ability to write these
				instructions and communicate with the computer can open up a whole new
				world. Let’s look at a few things that make computer programming such a
				great career option.

			<h2>Reasons Why do people love Programming!</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Coding is something that makes a difference. When you code, you get
					this feeling that you are helping people. Through code you can create
					something that people interact with, use, touch and work with. When
					you manage to build something that solves problems, you know that you
					are making a difference in someone else's life. That is an amazing
					feeling.
				</li>
				<li>
					Constant learning. Programming languages are constantly progressing
					and getting better, therefore you will find yourself learning all the
					times. According to the latest Hackerrank survey, programming
					ecosystem is rapidly changing at a fast with new frameworks and tools
					appearing sometimes way too often. It is not happening to deliberately
					mess up your life. It happens because programming advances and that is
					a thing to get excited about!
				</li>
				<li>
					Challenge. Many aspects of programming are challenging. Building up
					requirements, designing clear and scalable systems, writing efficient
					code and debugging in a multi-threaded environment are not easy tasks.
					Surprisingly, mental challenges are one of the things that excites
					Barcelona Code School students the most. Programming languages have
					strict logic that you must comply with at all times, but there is
					almost an infinite number of ways to write a program to solve given
					problem.
				</li>
